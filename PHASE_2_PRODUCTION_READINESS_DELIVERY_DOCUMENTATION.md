// Error: React hooks not available

// AFTER: Successfully compiled
import React, { useEffect, useState, useRef, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react'
import { io, Socket } from 'socket.io-client'
```

#### Issue 2: State Management Optimization
```typescript
// BEFORE: Potential infinite loops
const data = store.getState()
