# Organization Slug & Shortlink Implementation Report

## Build Analysis Summary
- The previous build allowed zero-length slugs to reach the database and trimmed names inconsistently between frontend and backend. The repository now normalizes input, enforces a 63 character cap, and raises typed errors when the slug cannot be derived, preventing blank inserts. 【F:backend/app/modules/organizations/repository.py†L27-L45】【F:backend/app/modules/organizations/repository.py†L68-L103】
- Organization creation now returns explicit `422` validation failures for malformed slugs and `409` conflicts when the slug is already taken, matching the documented behaviour expected by the workspace hub. 【F:backend/app/modules/organizations/service.py†L35-L66】
- Human-readable shortlinks were previously undocumented in code. The new FastAPI module resolves project, task, and channel IDs to scoped URLs, emitting 404/409 responses and logging missing scope anomalies. 【F:backend/app/modules/shortlinks/repository.py†L12-L77】【F:backend/app/modules/shortlinks/service.py†L10-L54】【F:backend/app/modules/shortlinks/router.py†L9-L35】
- Next.js now exposes `/p/:projectId`, `/t/:taskId`, and `/c/:channelId` pages backed by a shared resolving splash component that authenticates, calls the resolver API, and handles fallbacks gracefully. 【F:src/components/global/resolving-splash.tsx†L1-L129】【F:src/app/p/[projectId]/page.tsx†L1-L8】【F:src/app/t/[taskId]/page.tsx†L1-L8】【F:src/app/c/[channelId]/page.tsx†L1-L8】
- Frontend slug handling matches the backend contract: user input is normalized through a shared helper, the auto-suggest effect no longer reintroduces invalid characters, and the schema enforces the new length limit. 【F:src/lib/slug.ts†L1-L23】【F:src/app/workspace-hub/components/OrgCreationForm.tsx†L19-L175】
- Slug availability checks are debounced with explicit in-flight guards so the workspace hub only hits the backend once per slug per debounce window, eliminating the log spam observed during manual testing. 【F:src/app/workspace-hub/components/OrgCreationForm.tsx†L39-L159】

## Follow-up Recommendations
- Instrument shortlink resolution metrics once production data is available to monitor how often scoped division keys are missing.
- Plan a Supabase data backfill to correct legacy `organizations.slug` and `divisions.key` values using the updated normalization rules.
- Extend resolver coverage to documents and other entity types once their canonical routes are finalised.
