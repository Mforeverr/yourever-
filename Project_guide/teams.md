Absolutely. Here’s a **from-zero, end-to-end flow** for how **Teams** work alongside **Divisions**—with a simple office-building analogy to keep it memorable, and concrete actions you can build into the UI + data layer.

---

# The Analogy (one line each step)

* **Organization = Building.**
* **Divisions = Floors.**
* **Teams = Squads of people** who are allowed to work on specific floors.
* **Projects = Rooms** on a floor.
* **Tasks = Work items** inside a room.
* **Links/Grants = Keys** that let a team enter a specific room.

A squad may be allowed on several floors (active divisions), but they still **need a key to a room** (link to a project) to work there.

---

# 0) Create Organization (Building)

**Route:** `/onboarding/workspace-hub`
**User action:** Name org → Create
**DB writes:**

* `organizations`: (id, name, slug)
* `memberships`: (org_id, user_id, role=`owner`) ← creator becomes owner

**Result:** You now own the building.

---

# 1) Add Divisions (Floors)

**Route:** `/onboarding/workspace-hub` (step: Divisions)
**User action:** Add “Marketing”, “Engineering”, etc.
**DB writes:**

* `divisions`: one row per floor → `(id, org_id, name, key)`

**Rule of thumb:** You need floors first because **projects live on floors** and URLs are scoped to floors: `/:orgId/:divisionId/...`

---

# 2) Create Teams (Squads at org level), choose Active Divisions (floors allowed)

**Route:** `/onboarding/workspace-hub` (step: Teams)
**User action:** Create teams (“Growth Squad”, “Brand Creative”, “Platform”). For each team, tick which floors they are allowed to work on (Active Divisions).
**DB writes:**

* `teams`: `(id, org_id, name, kind)`
* `team_divisions`: one row per allowed floor → `(team_id, division_id)`

**Analogy:** You’ve registered a squad and told reception which floors they’re allowed to access **in principle**. (But they still need keys to rooms—projects—later.)

---

# 3) Invite Users and add them to Teams

**Route:** `/onboarding/invite`
**User action:** Invite by email; assign org role (viewer/member/admin), optionally add to teams (lead/member/guest).
**DB writes:**

* `users`: one per invitation/acceptance
* `memberships`: `(org_id, user_id, role)`
* `team_members`: `(team_id, user_id, role)`  // lead/member/guest

**Notes:**

* **Org role** controls global admin capabilities.
* **Team role** controls what they can do through the team (e.g., team “manager” over a project).

---

# 4) Create Projects (Rooms on a floor) and give Teams a Key (link)

**Route:** `/:orgId/:divisionId/workspace` → “New Project”
**User action:** Choose a **Division** for the project, set name, link one or more Teams (and/or direct members).
**DB writes:**

* `projects`: `(id, org_id, division_id, name, created_by)`
* `project_teams`: one per link `(project_id, team_id, role)` → `viewer/contributor/manager`
* *(optional)* `project_members`: `(project_id, user_id, role)` for direct individual access

**Guardrail (important):**
When linking a team to a project, **only allow** if that team is **active in the project’s division**.

* Constraint/RLS idea: `INSERT project_teams` requires a matching row in `team_divisions(team_id, division_id=project.division_id)`.

**Analogy:** You just picked a room on Floor Marketing, and handed **keys** to the Brand team. Now that team can enter this room.

---

# 5) Create Tasks (Work inside a room), assign to a User or a Team

**Route:** `/:orgId/:divisionId/p/:projectId` → “New Task”
**User action:** Create tasks; assign to a **user** or to a **team**.
**DB writes:**

* `tasks`: `(id, org_id, division_id, project_id, title, status, priority, due_date, created_by)`
* `task_assignees`:

  * if user assignment → `(task_id, user_id)`
  * if team assignment → *(two good options)*

    1. keep a separate `task_team_assignees(task_id, team_id)` **or**
    2. store a synthetic “assignee: team” field (but M2M is cleaner)

**Behavior:**

* If assigned to a **team**, the task shows up in the team’s **Inbox** for that division; any member can “**Take task**” (claim), which adds them as a user assignee while keeping the team as a watcher/stakeholder.

**Analogy:** You pin a post-it on the room wall either to a person or to the whole squad. If to the squad, anyone from the squad can pick it up.

---

# 6) Access Rules (What can users see/edit?)

**Route scopes:** always `/:orgId/:divisionId/...`
**Read (see project/task) if ALL are true:**

1. `row.org_id = active org`, and
2. `(row.division_id IS NULL OR row.division_id = active division)`, and
3. user is an **org member**, and
4. **any** of:

   * user is a **direct project member**, **or**
   * user is in any **team** that’s linked to the project (via `project_teams`) **and** that team is **active** in the division, **or**
   * *(optional policy)* user is a **task assignee** (user or via team) for that task.

**Write (create/update):**

* role ≥ **member** at org, **and**
* (direct project role ≥ contributor **or** team’s project role ≥ contributor)
* destructive ops (delete/permissions) → **admin/owner** or project “manager”.

**Analogy:** You can enter a room on a floor if you’re in the building, you’re on that floor, and you either have your own key, your squad has a key, or your name is on the task card.

# 7) Daily Use (how it feels in the app)

### Switch floors (Divisions)

URL: `/:orgId/:divisionId/dashboard`

* Sidebar and filters show **only** resources for that floor.
* Team filters (chips) narrow to tasks/projects where the team has keys **on that floor**.

### Team views

* Filter by `assignee: @team` or `linked-to: @team` to see that team’s queue for the current floor.
* Team presence + standup summary (AI-ready) aggregates the team’s linked projects on the active floor.

### Projects

* Start a project in a division; link one or more teams; new tasks default to `assignee: @team` or to a template assignee rule.

### Channels/Docs/Events (same pattern)

* Create in a division; link teams; members of those teams get in by default.

---

# 8) Edge Cases & Lifecycle

* **Team not active in a division** → UI disables linking to projects in that division; backend rejects inserts.
* **Remove a user from org** → their authored content remains (org-owned); remove from `team_members` and `project_members`; tasks reassign or keep team as stakeholder.
* **Change team’s active divisions** → removing a division can auto-remove invalid `project_teams` links (with confirmation) or mark them as **invalid** until fixed.
* **Cross-division squad** → a team active in A & B sees work only when user is scoped to A or B respectively. No cross-leak in one view unless you build an org-wide rollup page.

---

# 9) Minimal Data Footprint per Step (cheat sheet)

1. **Org** → `organizations`, `memberships(owner)`
2. **Divisions** → `divisions` (per floor)
3. **Teams** → `teams` + `team_divisions` (per team × floor) + `team_members`
4. **Projects** → `projects` (must pick a division) + `project_teams` (keys) + *(optional)* `project_members`
5. **Tasks** → `tasks` + `task_assignees` (user or team)
6. **Comments/Docs/Events** → same org/div rules; optional team links tables

---

# 10) Example (2 minutes)

**Goal:** “Growth Squad” works on **Marketing** and **Product** floors.

1. Create org **Acme** → you’re **owner**.
2. Create divisions: **Marketing**, **Product**.
3. Create team **Growth Squad**, mark active in: **Marketing**, **Product**.
4. Invite **Rina**, **Joko** (org role: member). Add both to Growth Squad (team role: member).
5. Create project **Website Revamp** in **Marketing** → link **Growth Squad** (contributor).
6. Create task **Refactor hero** in that project → assign to **@growth-squad**.
7. Rina “**Takes**” the task → now task shows Rina (assignee) + Growth Squad (watcher/stakeholder).
8. Switch to **Product** floor and create project **Pricing Experiments** → link Growth Squad (manager).
9. Growth Squad now works on both floors—but only sees each floor’s work when the URL is scoped to that floor.

---

# 11) Optional SQL/RLS ideas (pseudo)

* Enforce keys-only-where-allowed:

```sql
-- Only allow linking a team to a project if that team is active in the project's division
CREATE POLICY project_teams_insert ON project_teams
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM projects p
    JOIN team_divisions td ON td.team_id = project_teams.team_id
                           AND td.division_id = p.division_id
    WHERE p.id = project_teams.project_id
  )
);
```

* Read gates match the URL scope and grants:

```sql
-- Visible project if org & division match AND user is org member AND (direct member OR via team)
-- Tasks inherit project visibility (plus optional assignee override).
```

---

## TL;DR (what to build first)

1. **Onboarding wizard** in this order: Org → Divisions → Teams (+active divisions) → Invite Users → Projects (+team links) → Tasks.
2. **Team linking guardrails** so you **can’t** link a team to a project on a floor they’re not active in.
3. **Team assignment** to tasks + “Take task” action.
4. **Division-scoped UI** that shows only the floor you’re on; team filters operate within that floor.
