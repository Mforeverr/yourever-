### **File Organization:**
- Follow existing structure: `src/featureName/`
- Maintain client/server separation in subfolders
- Reuse existing UI components from `src/components/ui/`
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Implement VSCode shell components in `src/components/shell/`

### **Security & Quality Standards:**
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Ensure RLS policies enforce org/division isolation
- Implement proper session context management (app.user_id(), app.org_id(), app.division_id(), app.role())
- Ensure responsive design with existing dark mode
- Test with existing authentication flows
- Verify proper error handling with graceful degradation
- Keep performance in mind for multi-tenant queries
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
