# Onboarding Database Foundation - Implementation Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Card ID:** DONE-09
**Migration:** 016_add_user_onboarding_profile_fields.sql
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED

---

## âœ… Database Foundation Ready:

### 1. User Profile Fields Added:
- **displayName** - User's preferred name from onboarding
- **headline** - Professional tagline (e.g., "Product lead @ Yourever")
- **bio** - Professional biography
- **avatarUrl** - URL to uploaded avatar image
- **onboardingCompleted** - Boolean tracking completion status
- **onboardingStep** - Current step: profile, work-profile, tool-stack, invite, workspace-hub

### 2. Multi-tenant Structure Already Exists:
- **Organization** model with creator, settings, subscriptions
- **Division** model with org-scoped unique slugs
- **OrgMembership** with roles (owner, admin, member, viewer)
- Complete foreign key relationships and cascade deletions

### 3. Indexes for Performance:
- **idx_User_onboarding_status** for filtering by completion/step
- **idx_User_display_name** for searching users by name

---

## ðŸ”§ Onboarding Flow Architecture:

The onboarding wizard maps perfectly to the database:

1. **Profile Step** â†’ Updates `User.displayName`, `User.headline`, `User.bio`, `User.avatarUrl`
2. **Work Profile Step** â†’ Can store work preferences in `User.settings` JSON field
3. **Tool Stack Step** â†’ Can store tool preferences in `User.settings` JSON field
4. **Invite Step** â†’ Creates new `User` records and `OrgMembership` entries
5. **Workspace Hub Step** â†’ Creates/selects `Organization` and `Division` records

The existing onboarding pages are already well-designed and connect to this database structure. The mock organizations data in `WorkspaceHubStepPage` can easily be replaced with real database queries.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Implementation:

The database is fully ready for the onboarding system. The remaining work involves:

1. **Creating Wasp operations (queries/actions) for profile updates**
2. **Connecting the existing onboarding pages to real data**
3. **Implementing organization/division creation logic**
4. **Adding file upload for avatar images**

The relational structure is solid - users can belong to multiple organizations through `OrgMembership`, each organization can have multiple divisions, and the workspace shell already supports scoped routing with `orgId` and `divisionId` parameters.

## Technical Details:

### Migration File: `016_add_user_onboarding_profile_fields.sql`
```sql
-- Add onboarding profile fields to the User table
ALTER TABLE "User"
ADD COLUMN "displayName" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN "headline" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN "bio" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN "avatarUrl" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN "onboardingCompleted" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN "onboardingStep" TEXT DEFAULT 'profile';

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX "idx_User_onboarding_status" ON "User"("onboardingCompleted", "onboardingStep");
CREATE INDEX "idx_User_display_name" ON "User"("displayName") WHERE "displayName" IS NOT NULL;
```

### Updated Database Schema:
The User table now includes all necessary fields for storing onboarding progress and profile information. The existing multi-tenant structure (Organization â†’ Division â†’ User) provides the perfect foundation for the workspace selection step.

### Onboarding Pages Already Implemented:
- `/onboarding/profile` - ProfileStepPage.tsx âœ…
- `/onboarding/work-profile` - WorkProfileStepPage.tsx âœ…
- `/onboarding/tool-stack` - ToolStackStepPage.tsx âœ…
- `/onboarding/invite` - InviteStepPage.tsx âœ…
- `/onboarding/workspace-hub` - WorkspaceHubStepPage.tsx âœ…

All pages are already created with proper UI components and navigation logic.

## Impact:

This database foundation completes the core infrastructure needed for the onboarding system. The onboarding wizard can now:

- Track user progress through the 5-step flow
- Store user profile information entered during onboarding
- Connect users to organizations and divisions
- Support the VSCode-inspired workspace interface with proper scoping

The implementation follows all established patterns:
- Multi-tenant security through existing RLS policies
- Session-based org/division context
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Performance-optimized indexes
- Type-safe Wasp operations ready for implementation
