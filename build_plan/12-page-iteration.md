# 12 — Page-by-Page Feature Iteration Plan

## Objective
Deliver production-ready feature pages after foundational systems (auth, scope, live data) are stable. Emphasize reusable patterns, performance, accessibility, and observability for each page rollout.

## Strategy Overview
- Adopt slice-based delivery: tackle one page at a time end-to-end.
- Maintain consistent layout via WorkspaceShell contracts.
- Ensure each page relies on feature-flagged modules for safe deployments.

## Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Audit & Prioritization**
   - Inventory all pages (Dashboard, Projects, Calendar, Files, Settings, etc.).
   - Rank by business impact and backend readiness.
   - Define acceptance criteria, KPIs, and SLIs for each page.
2. **Component Library Alignment**
   - Verify design tokens, typography, spacing in Tailwind config.
   - Standardize reusable widgets (cards, charts, tables) with accessibility baked in.
3. **Data Contracts**
   - For each page, document required backend endpoints and payloads in OpenAPI.
   - Ensure domain services expose necessary methods without breaking OCP.

## Phase 2: Execution Template (Repeat per Page)
1. **Backend Workstream**
   - Implement REST endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/:orgId/:divisionId/dashboard`) returning filtered, paginated data.
   - Use service layer + repository pattern; reuse existing domain modules by extension.
   - Add Prisma migrations for new tables as additive changes (e.g., `dashboard_widgets`).
   - Enforce authorization based on scope + feature flags.
   - Provide caching or projections (materialized views) for expensive aggregates.
2. **Frontend Workstream**
   - Scaffold page component under `src/app/(workspace)/[orgId]/[divisionId]/page-name/page.tsx` following Next.js conventions.
   - Use React Query hooks for data fetching with suspense-friendly APIs.
   - Implement skeleton loaders, empty states, and error boundaries.
   - Ensure responsive layout and keyboard navigation.
   - Integrate i18n using existing translation utilities.
3. **State Management**
   - Keep server data within React Query caches; store only view-state (filters, sorting) in local Zustand slices.
   - Sync filters with URL query params for shareability.
4. **Security & Compliance**
   - Validate inputs on backend (schema validation via Zod/JOI).
   - Sanitize user-generated content before rendering (DOMPurify for HTML snippets).
   - Audit logging for sensitive actions (e.g., settings changes).
   - Ensure GDPR compliance (consent for tracking, data minimization).
5. **Error Handling**
   - Standardize toast messaging, inline validation errors.
   - Backend returns structured errors with codes (e.g., `DASHBOARD_FILTER_INVALID`).
   - Frontend surfaces correlation IDs for support.
6. **Performance**
   - Lazy-load non-critical widgets via dynamic imports.
   - Apply request batching where possible.
   - Instrument with `web-vitals` and send to analytics.
7. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for domain services and controllers.
   - Integration tests verifying DB queries and authorization.
   - Component tests (RTL) for UI states.
   - Playwright e2e covering core user journeys per page.
   - Performance budgets enforced via Lighthouse CI.
8. **Observability**
   - Expose metrics per page: load time, error rate, engagement.
   - Set up logs/traces with OpenTelemetry spans from request to render.

## Phase 3: Release Management
- Feature flag each page (`page.dashboard.enabled`, etc.) with gradual rollout.
- Deploy backend first, then frontend toggled for internal QA.
- Collect telemetry and user feedback before expanding audience.
- Maintain rollback checklist per page.

## Phase 4: Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular review of analytics to iterate on UX/performance.
- Keep regression suite updated when adding widgets or filters.
- Document learnings in engineering handbook.

## Dependencies
- Auth, scope, live data, and hub normalization plans completed.
- Stable design system assets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each released page meets performance SLOs (<2 s LCP, error rate <1%).
- Full-stack test coverage in CI for the page.
- Runbooks updated with troubleshooting steps per feature.
